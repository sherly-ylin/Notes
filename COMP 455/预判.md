- Write a regular expression for this language
- Write a CFG for a language
- Is this language regular? if not, use pumping lemma to prove it
- Convert an NFA into DFA

- Prove A is (not) decidable/Turing-recognizable [reduction]

- Given a reduction, does this reduction satisfy the forward/backward direction?
- Prove B is NP-complete by reducing A to B
