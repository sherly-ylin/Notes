## 出题方式：
- variants of known ALG
- Greedy ALG for a problem
- Prove correctness
- diff input/condition etc.
- reduce a problem to another:
  - Matching --> Max flow
  - Weighted SCI --> Max independent set
  - NP-Hard:
    - 3-SAT ≤ IS
    - VC ≤ DomSet
    - HamPath ≤ HamCycle
  - Vertex Cover - Matching (2-approx)

Examples:

- find 

## 2,5. Graph 
- check connectedness(BFS,DFS)
- detect cycle(DFS find backedge)
- shortest cycle
- find negative cycle

## 6. Flow 


- Max flow
- Matching
- Min Vertex Cover
- Min s-t Cut
- Prove feasible and optimal

## 8. NP-Hard
> Decision problem: does A has an instance s.t satisfies condition = k? - yes or no
### Prove a problem is NP-Hard
#### 1. Find a reduction from A to B (show A≤B)
#### 2. Prove a reduction f satisfy the forward and backword condition
   1. [=>] if x is a yes instance of A, then f(x) is a yes instance of A
   2. [<=] if f(x) is a yes instance of B, then x is yes for A
        <=>if x is a no for A, then f(x) is a no for B

Problems:
- 3-SAT ≤ IS
  ```
  create a ∆ for each clause {y1 v y2 v y3}, add to G
  for u in G:
    for v in G[u]: #add conflict edges
        if u, v are negation of each other: add {u,v}
  ```
- VC ≤ DomSet
- HamPath ≤ HamCycle
- IS ≤ VC
- 
## 9. 2-Approximation

### Prove given ALG is a 2-approximation algorithm
#### Show ALG(x) ≤ 2*OPT(x)
